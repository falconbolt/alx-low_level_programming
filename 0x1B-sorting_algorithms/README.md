# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Compiled with `gcc 4.8.4`, with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic` flags.

**Focus:** Understand at least four different sorting algorithms. What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm? How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input? What is a stable sorting algorithm?
